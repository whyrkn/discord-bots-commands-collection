## What are we doing?

We are storing all the different commands and features of Discord bots in one repository in every well-known language and their packages.


## Project Structure

Each folder contains subfolders of languages we want commands to be written in please submit your pull request in that order only.

**Accepted languages are as follows:**

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-FFD43B?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=blue
)

![Javascript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-323330?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=F7DF1E
)

![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-ED8B00?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=white
)

**Accepted packages are as follows:**
- [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) (or similar forks)
- [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js)
- [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) (Java Discord Api)

*you are free to suggest new languages (they must be popular enough for making discord bots and should have a stable package to work with)*


## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For adding a new command, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to add, and for rewriting pre-existing things in a new language please submit your pull request.
